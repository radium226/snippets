To Do
=====
 - Push the `file_operations` snippet
 - Try `fexecve` (or `execve`) and change process name
 - Try `mmap`
 - Implement `aes_open`, `aes_seek`, etc. to open and write transparently AES encrypted files
 - Do some unit testing
 - Expand macro in of a `.c` file with `gcc -E`
 - Find a good way to handle errors (with `goto`? with `setjmp` and `longjmp`?) 
 - Make more tests with signals
 - Try to serialize data
